# Hi there 👋, I'm Liam Wang Wohlstedt

IT Support Technician @ MSAB | Exploring IT, automation, and software development  

I’ve been working across multiple IT fields, from **networking and Linux systems to IoT and security**. Along the way, I’ve been building small software projects to expand my skills, including **Python scripts for automation, Raspberry Pi and Arduino projects, and data workflows**.  

Currently, I’m **learning C++ and C#**, and applying them in personal projects to strengthen my programming skills while continuing to grow in IT support and system administration.
